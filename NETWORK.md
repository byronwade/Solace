1\. Standard HTTP/HTTPS Network

Description: The default web browsing network that uses HTTP and HTTPS protocols for secure communication.

Use Case: Normal browsing with encrypted (HTTPS) or unencrypted (HTTP) data transfer.

Key Features:

HTTPS provides end-to-end encryption.

Fast and direct connection to the internet.

2\. Tor Network

Description: An anonymity-preserving network that routes traffic through a series of volunteer-operated nodes (relays).

Use Case: Private and anonymous browsing, access to .onion sites.

Setup Guide: Integrate with Tor using Arti (Tor's Rust Client) or the full Tor Project.

Key Features:

High anonymity for users.

Access to hidden services (.onion domains).

3\. VPN (Virtual Private Network)

Description: A network type where traffic is routed through encrypted tunnels to a remote server, masking the user's IP address.

Use Case: General privacy, bypassing geographic restrictions, and securing public Wi-Fi connections.

Setup Guide: Integrate with VPN services like OpenVPN (https://openvpn.net/) or WireGuard (https://www.wireguard.com/).

Key Features:

Encrypts all network traffic.

Provides virtual geolocation.

4\. Proxy Network

Description: Routes traffic through an intermediary server (proxy) that acts as a gateway to the internet.

Use Case: Simple IP masking, bypassing content restrictions.

Setup Guide: Allow users to configure HTTP or SOCKS proxies.

Key Features:

Supports multiple protocols (HTTP, SOCKS5).

Simpler than a VPN but without encryption.

5\. DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)

Description: Encrypts DNS queries, preventing third parties from intercepting or tracking DNS lookups.

Use Case: Enhanced privacy for standard browsing.

Setup Guide: Use libraries like Trust-DNS to implement DoH.

Key Features:

Prevents ISP-level DNS tracking.

Works seamlessly with HTTP/HTTPS browsing.

6\. DNS-over-TLS (DoT)

Description: A protocol similar to DoH that encrypts DNS queries but uses a distinct port and protocol (TLS).

Use Case: DNS encryption for privacy enthusiasts who prefer non-HTTP solutions.

Setup Guide: Use Trust-DNS for DoT integration.

Key Features:

Privacy-focused DNS security.

Can be used with regular HTTP/HTTPS browsing.

7\. I2P (Invisible Internet Project)

Description: A privacy network focused on peer-to-peer connections and anonymized routing.

Use Case: Access to I2P-specific sites (.i2p domains) and private communications.

Setup Guide: Use the I2P SDK for integration.

Key Features:

Designed for anonymous peer-to-peer communication.

Offers unique *.i2p services.

8\. Freenet

Description: A decentralized, censorship-resistant network for secure communication and file sharing.

Use Case: Sharing content and hosting sites in a completely decentralized manner.

Setup Guide: Integrate with the Freenet project.

Key Features:

Focuses on anonymity and censorship resistance.

Fully decentralized content hosting.

9\. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks

Description: A network where users connect directly without centralized servers.

Use Case: Decentralized file sharing or communication.

Setup Guide: Use protocols like libp2p for decentralized networking.

Key Features:

No reliance on centralized servers.

Often used in blockchain or IPFS ecosystems.

10\. Decentralized Web Access (IPFS)

Description: A content-addressable, peer-to-peer network for hosting decentralized files and websites.

Use Case: Accessing or hosting decentralized content.

Setup Guide: Use the IPFS API to integrate browsing capabilities.

Key Features:

Decentralized and resilient hosting.

Great for blockchain and crypto-related content.

11\. Blockchain-Based Networks

Description: Networks like Ethereum Name Service (ENS) or Handshake, used for decentralized domain resolution.

Use Case: Accessing .eth, .crypto, or other blockchain-based domains.

Setup Guide: Use libraries like ens.js or Unstoppable Domains SDK.

Key Features:

Fully decentralized DNS.

Works seamlessly with crypto wallets and blockchain systems.

12\. Local Network (Intranet)

Description: Restricts browsing to local, offline resources hosted within an intranet or local server.

Use Case: Private networks, corporate or educational use.

Key Features:

Localized access to hosted resources.

Completely offline.

13\. Onion over VPN

Description: Combines Tor and VPN, routing traffic through a VPN before entering the Tor network.

Use Case: Enhanced privacy and anonymity with an added layer of encryption.

Setup Guide: Combine Tor configuration with a VPN client like OpenVPN or WireGuard.

Key Features:

Prevents ISPs from detecting Tor usage.

Adds an extra encryption layer.

14\. ZeroNet

Description: A peer-to-peer web network using Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent for decentralized hosting.

Use Case: Hosting decentralized websites or apps.

Setup Guide: Use the ZeroNet SDK.

Key Features:

Decentralized hosting with built-in cryptographic security.

Resistant to censorship.

15\. Custom Proxy Networks

Description: Networks tailored for specific routing or privacy needs (e.g., SOCKS5, Shadowsocks).

Use Case: Advanced users who require specific configurations.

Setup Guide: Allow users to manually enter proxy server details.

Key Features:

Flexibility in routing options.

Lightweight compared to full VPNs.
