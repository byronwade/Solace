# **Solace Browser**

---

## **Overview**
**Solace** is an open-source, privacy-first web browser that reimagines how users interact with the web. Inspired by the strengths of existing browsers like Chrome, Brave, and Tor Browser, **Solace** aims to deliver exceptional speed, security, privacy, and user empowerment. It achieves this through a combination of multi-engine flexibility, cutting-edge security protocols, and comprehensive support for decentralized and privacy-oriented networks.

Unlike traditional browsers, where the user is locked into a single engine and a fixed set of configurations, **Solace introduces the groundbreaking ability to dynamically select and swap the underlying rendering engine and network routing on a per-tab basis.** Users can seamlessly move from Blink to Gecko to Servo (or others), combine Tor with a VPN, or load decentralized content via IPFS, all from the same browser session. This level of flexibility, combined with robust security and privacy measures, provides unprecedented control over the browsing experience.

**Note on Complexity:**  
Implementing multi-engine support and per-tab routing is not a trivial extension of common desktop frameworks like Tauri or Electron. Instead, Solace takes a more low-level, systems-focused approach:
- It orchestrates multiple engine processes at the native layer using Rust.  
- It employs custom IPC channels and sandboxing to isolate engines.  
- It integrates a rich UI built with familiar web technologies (e.g., Next.js) but treats this UI as a front-end control panel rather than relying on a single integrated webview.  

This approach ensures we’re not constrained to one engine or a conventional architecture, allowing for a truly modular and secure browser environment.

## **Why Solace?**

Modern browsers have advanced significantly, but they still require trade-offs:
- **Google Chrome:** Exceptional speed, stability, and a broad feature set, yet deeply entwined with a large advertising and data-collection ecosystem.
- **Brave:** Privacy-enhancing by default, with tracker blocking and integrated reward systems. Still, it relies solely on Blink and a centralized approach.
- **Tor Browser:** Unparalleled anonymity and anti-fingerprinting measures, but limited to the Gecko engine and a fixed Tor-only networking model.

**Solace** synthesizes these strengths:
- **From Chrome:** Multi-process architecture, top-tier speed, and world-class compatibility.
- **From Brave:** Built-in tracker/ad blocking, strong privacy defaults, and rigorous security reviews.
- **From Tor Browser:** Anti-fingerprinting techniques, `.onion` support, and a philosophy centered on user anonymity.

**New Frontier—Multi-Engine Flexibility:**  
Solace stands apart by letting users select rendering engines and network routes per tab. Imagine loading a site in Blink for standard compatibility, then switching that same tab to Gecko to compare rendering or privacy impact—without opening a new window. Or browsing the open web via a standard HTTPS route alongside a separate tab tunneling through Tor+VPN for anonymity. This adaptability empowers developers, testers, researchers, and privacy-conscious users to shape their browsing environment at will.

## **Core Principles**
1. **Speed:**  
   Achieved via Rust implementation for core logic, leveraging async I/O, parallelization, and hardware acceleration. Each engine runs in its own optimized process, enabling granular resource management and performance tuning.

2. **Privacy:**  
   Privacy-by-default: built-in tracker blocking, anti-fingerprinting techniques, DNS encryption, anonymization layers (Tor, I2P, Freenet), and zero telemetry. Users control exactly how their data flows, on a per-tab basis.

3. **Security:**  
   Robust cryptography, sandboxing, memory safety from Rust, process isolation, and strict Content Security Policies (CSP). Regular security audits, fuzzing, and static analysis ensure a hardened environment.

4. **Decentralization:**  
   Native support for IPFS, blockchain-based domains (ENS, Handshake), ZeroNet, Freenet, and other decentralized protocols. Users access censorship-resistant content and distributed services directly.

5. **User Empowerment:**  
   Full control over engine choice, network routing (Tor, VPN, proxies), data retention, and resource usage per tab. No forced data collection. Complete configurability aligns the browser with individual user priorities and use-cases.

**Note:** The complexity of supporting multiple engines and intricate routing stems from this principle of user empowerment. Solace dares to go beyond the norm, granting end-users capabilities usually reserved for specialized tools or separate browsers.

## **Detailed Feature Breakdown**

### **1. Multi-Engine Architecture**
At the heart of Solace is a modular, extensible approach to rendering engines. By abstracting engine operations behind a stable Rust API, the browser core manages each engine as an isolated, sandboxed process.

**Supported Engines:**
- **Blink (Chromium):**  
  Industry-standard for modern web apps, robust extension ecosystem, excellent compatibility.
- **Gecko (Mozilla Firefox/Tor):**  
  Privacy-oriented, open-source, strong support from the Tor community.
- **WebKit (Safari/Epiphany):**  
  A lighter footprint engine, useful for certain performance profiles or Apple-centric environments.
- **Servo (Rust-Based, Experimental):**  
  Parallelized layout and rendering, cutting-edge security and performance research.
- **QtWebEngine (Chromium-based):**  
  Ideal for embedded devices or Qt-based UI integrations, stable and versatile.
- **Goanna (Pale Moon/Basilisk):**  
  A Gecko-fork offering distinctive compatibility modes for legacy or niche sites.
- **wke (Lightweight WebKit):**  
  Minimalistic engine for specialized or resource-constrained scenarios.
- **Trident (Legacy IE Engine) & EdgeHTML (Legacy Edge Engine):**  
  For corporate intranets or legacy enterprise systems that still rely on older rendering modes.
- **UXP (Unified XUL Platform):**  
  Mozilla-based platform for applications needing XUL-based extensions.

**Per-Tab Engine Switching:**
- Users can choose the engine per tab in real-time. Start with Blink, switch to Gecko, or test a page in Servo—all in the same tab session.
- Useful for developers debugging cross-engine issues, privacy advocates testing fingerprinting differences, and users who prefer a different engine’s performance profile for certain sites.

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Rust Core Orchestration:**  
  A central Rust core manages all engines, handling their lifecycle, memory allocation strategies, and IPC channels.
- **Isolated Processes:**  
  Each engine runs in a separate, sandboxed process, similar to Chrome’s site isolation, preventing a compromised engine from affecting the entire browser.
- **IPC Channels & Rendering Updates:**  
  A custom communication protocol relays commands (navigate, reload, switch engine) and events (page loaded, error occurred) between the UI, the Rust orchestrator, and the engine processes.
- **Custom Memory Allocators & Sandboxing:**  
  Fine-tuned allocators minimize overhead, while OS-level sandboxing (seccomp on Linux, AppContainer on Windows) restrict engine processes’ capabilities, enhancing security.

**Note:**  
This multi-engine model extends beyond what frameworks like Tauri can do by default. Instead of one integrated webview, Solace integrates multiple native engines, coordinated by Rust. The UI layer is separate, treating engines like interchangeable “viewports.”

### **2. Privacy and Security**

**Privacy Features:**
- **Tor Integration (Arti-based):**  
  Seamless `.onion` domain support. Activate Tor mode per tab, enabling anonymous routing without affecting other tabs.
- **Tracker & Ad Blocking:**  
  Embedded blocklists (EasyList, EasyPrivacy), advanced filtering akin to Brave’s shields. Blocks fingerprinting scripts, cryptominers, and cross-site trackers by default.
- **DNS Encryption:**  
  DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) and DNS-over-TLS (DoT) ensure ISPs can’t log DNS queries. Users can choose trusted resolvers.
- **Anti-Fingerprinting:**  
  Techniques inspired by Tor Browser: uniform user agent strings, consistent window sizes, neutralized canvas fingerprinting, restricted hardware concurrency info.
- **No Telemetry / Zero Data Collection:**  
  No unsolicited data sharing. Personalization is local, opt-in, and easily inspected.

**Security Features:**
- **Sandboxing & Process Isolation:**  
  Each tab: a low-privilege process. Each engine instance: similarly restricted. Reduces the blast radius of exploits.
- **HTTPS Enforcement:**  
  Automatic upgrades to HTTPS where possible, blocking insecure requests. This resembles HTTPS Everywhere at the browser level.
- **Certificate Pinning:**  
  Critical domains pinned to known certificates, thwarting MITM attacks.
- **Memory Safety (Rust Core):**  
  Rust ensures memory safety at compile time. No classic overflow bugs in core logic.
- **Regular Security Audits & Fuzzing:**  
  Inspired by Brave’s security reviews and Tor’s academic scrutiny. Automated fuzz tests catch vulnerabilities early.

### **3. Network and Protocol Support**

**Flexible Networking Per Tab:**
1. **Standard HTTP/HTTPS:**  
   TLS 1.3 by default for cutting-edge security.
2. **Tor Network:**  
   `.onion` addresses, onion routing, per-tab Tor mode.
3. **VPN Integration (OpenVPN, WireGuard):**  
   Configure a system or in-browser VPN for selected tabs. Route traffic through secure tunnels easily.
4. **Proxy Support (HTTP, SOCKS5):**  
   Assign proxies on a per-tab basis for quick IP rotation or testing.
5. **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) & DNS-over-TLS (DoT):**  
   Encrypted DNS queries for privacy against ISP snooping.
6. **I2P Integration:**  
   Access `.i2p` domains to tap into peer-to-peer anonymous networks.
7. **Freenet & ZeroNet:**  
   Decentralized, censorship-resistant protocols accessible directly.
8. **IPFS:**  
   Native `ipfs://` URI support, enabling distributed content access.
9. **Blockchain DNS (ENS, Handshake, Unstoppable):**  
   Resolve `.eth`, `.crypto`, `.zil` without intermediaries.
10. **Local Network/Intranet:**  
    Ideal for enterprise environments or offline usage.
11. **Onion over VPN:**  
    Layer Tor traffic on top of a VPN for added obfuscation.
12. **Custom Proxy Networks:**  
    Integrate Shadowsocks or specialized proxies by user configuration.

**Network UI:**
- A dedicated “Network & Privacy” panel.  
- Real-time indicators show per-tab routing (e.g., “Tor + VPN” or “DoH Enabled”).
- Simple toggles for advanced privacy modes, making complex setups accessible to less technical users.

### **4. Decentralized Web and Crypto Integration**
- **Crypto Domains:**  
  `.eth`, `.crypto`, `.zil` resolve through ENS or other blockchain-based DNS solutions.
- **Freenet, I2P, ZeroNet:**  
  Accessing decentralized content that resists censorship or single points of failure.
- **IPFS Integration:**  
  Direct IPFS gateway access or embedded IPFS node. Ideal for distributing static sites, files, or DApps.
- **Future Crypto Wallet Support:**  
  Manage decentralized identities, interact with Web3 apps, and streamline blockchain-based services inside the browser.

### **5. Performance and Optimization**
- **Rust Core:**  
  Non-blocking async I/O (Tokio), lock-free data structures where possible, and minimized context switches.
- **Hardware Acceleration:**  
  GPU-accelerated compositing, WebGL rendering, and offloading tasks to the GPU.
- **Dynamic Caching & Resource Isolation:**  
  Adaptive caching techniques learn from browsing patterns, preloading frequently visited sites. Unused tabs get suspended, freeing CPU/RAM.
- **Parallelization:**  
  By running multiple engines in parallel, user can load heavy pages in one tab while reading static text in another without sluggishness.

### **6. Developer Experience**
- **Developer Tools:**  
  Multi-engine devtools: Inspect Blink performance or Gecko’s CSS grid rendering from a unified panel.
- **Engine Comparison Mode:**  
  Load the same site in Blink and Gecko side-by-side to see rendering differences or performance disparities.
- **Network Analysis Tools:**  
  Packet-level inspection (with permission) to debug complex routing setups (Tor circuits, DNS queries, VPN tunnels).

### **7. User Interface and Usability**
- **Minimalist, Customizable UI:**  
  Next.js-based front-end provides a modern, responsive interface. Engine/network indicators in the address bar. Simple toggles for privacy modes.
- **Settings and Privacy Toggles:**  
  From disabling WebRTC leaks to specifying default engines per domain, users fine-tune the experience easily.
- **Focus Mode:**  
  Hide bars, menus, and distractions for a clean reading or working environment.

**Note on UI Architecture:**  
Instead of relying on a single integrated webview (like Tauri’s default model), Solace treats the UI as a separate, privileged interface. The UI (built in Next.js) is compiled to static assets and served locally. A custom Rust-based windowing solution (possibly using `wry` and `tao`) displays the UI in one area while embedding separate surfaces or windows for engine-rendered pages. This modular design allows the UI to remain stable and responsive, even when switching engines or loading complex content.

## **How We’re Building It**

**Tech Stack Details:**
- **Language:**  
  Rust for the core, ensuring memory safety and concurrency benefits.
- **Engines:**  
  Dynamically linked binaries (CEF for Blink, Gecko embedding, Servo builds, etc.), each managed by a Rust wrapper.  
- **UI Layer:**  
  - Next.js for the UI front-end, compiled to static files.  
  - A custom Rust-based shell using crates like `wry` or `tao` handles window management.  
  - The UI communicates with the Rust core via a secure IPC layer, controlling engine selection and network settings.
- **Networking:**  
  Tokio for async I/O, Arti for Tor, Trust-DNS for DoH/DoT.  
- **Security Hardening:**  
  Compiler flags (`-fstack-protector-strong`, `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, `-fPIE`), OS-level sandboxing (AppArmor/SELinux, AppContainer), reproducible builds.

**Build Process:**
- **Reproducible Builds:**  
  Ensuring deterministic builds for security and auditability.
- **CI Pipeline:**  
  Automated testing on Linux, macOS, Windows.  
  Clippy lint checks, fuzzing with AFL/LibFuzzer, static analysis.
  
**Inspiration from Chrome, Brave, Tor:**
- **Chrome:** Multi-process site isolation and performance optimizations guide our engine isolation and GPU acceleration.
- **Brave:** Built-in privacy filters, zero telemetry principles, and emphasis on user-first privacy inform default configurations.
- **Tor Browser:** Anti-fingerprinting patches, uniform user agents, and integration of anonymity networks influence our anonymity modes and per-tab routing.

**Note:**  
This approach is more complex than a standard desktop app. Instead of wrapping one engine (like Tauri does with a system webview), we orchestrate multiple engines, handle separate processes, and render them side-by-side. The UI built with Next.js is familiar to web developers but must be integrated into this custom ecosystem.
